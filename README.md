# Stock Price Prediction Based on TimesNet

## Data Collection

The stock data is collected using the open-source financial interface AkShare, retrieving relevant stock market data. The dataset used in this project originates from East Money (东方财富网) - Market Homepage - Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Beijing A-Shares - Daily Market Data.

## Data Preprocessing

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and duplicate data.

Data Transformation: Standardization, normalization, and encoding categorical variables.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features, selecting important features, and performing dimensionality reduction.

## Model Training and Evaluation

The model is trained using the training dataset, while validation and test datasets are used to assess performance. The evaluation metrics used include:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

Mean Squared Percentage Error (MSPE)

##  This project leverages TimesNet（https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library） for time-series stock price prediction, focusing on accurate market trend forecasting.
